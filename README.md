# Pokemon Yellow Gambling
# Update!!! THE GAME CHEATS! :( 
I thought it was a performance issue. However, after extensive testing, I came to the unfortunate truth that the game cheats. Upon looking at the decompiled assembly code of the ROM, my suspicion has been confirmed with the **'GameCornerSelectLuckySlotMachine'** script.

This project uses **OpenCV**. Ensure you have it installed and properly configured.

### Installation and Configuration:

1. **Install OpenCV**:  
   - Visit [OpenCV's official site](https://opencv.org/get-started/) to get started with the installation.

2. **Configure Visual Studio for OpenCV**:  
   Once you've installed OpenCV, you'll need to configure Visual Studio to link with its DLL files.

3. **Organize DLL files**:  
   Ensure the DLL files are placed in the appropriate folders. For example:

   - Debug mode: `opencv_worldXXXd.dll` should be in your project's debug path directory.
   - Release mode: `opencv_worldXXX.dll` should be in your project's release path directory.

     ```plaintext
     C:\yourPath\pokemonYellowGambling\x64\Debug\opencv_world481d.dll
     C:\yourPath\pokemonYellowGambling\x64\Release\opencv_world481.dll
     ```

4. **Switch Compiler to C++v17+**:  
   This project requires C++v17 or higher due to its reliance on `std::filesystem`. To switch:
